## Overview

Learning something new can be daunting, especially figuring out *what* to learn and in *what order*. This AI Tutor aims to simplify that process. Whether you're diving into a complex subject or need to brush up on foundational concepts, this tool assists by:

1.  Collaboratively building a syllabus based on your goals.
2.  Providing explanations tailored to your preferred style and depth.
3.  Guiding your learning journey with a custom-generated "explainer" AI.

Security measures and checks have been implemented within the codebase to ensure safe operation.

## How It Works üß†

1.  **Define Your Goal:** The user specifies the topic they want to learn and their objective (e.g., "Learn Python basics for web development," "Master calculus prerequisites for machine learning").
2.  **Syllabus Generation:** Based on the user's input and judgment, the AI proposes a structured syllabus or learning path. The user can review and potentially adjust this.
3.  **Tailored Explanations:** For each topic in the syllabus, the user can request an explanation. Crucially, the user can specify *how* they want it explained (e.g., "Explain like I'm 10," "Provide a highly technical overview," "Use analogies related to cooking").
4.  **Custom Explainer Prompt:** A unique, custom prompt is generated behind the scenes. This "explainer" persona guides the AI's responses, ensuring consistency and adherence to the user's learning preferences throughout the session.
5.  **Iterative Learning:** The user progresses through the syllabus, requesting explanations and potentially asking follow-up questions, with the AI adapting its responses accordingly.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Tutor locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Git
*   PostgreSQL Server (Running locally or accessible)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file:** Copy the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit the `.env` file:** Open the `.env` file in your text editor and fill in the required values. This will typically include:
    *   `DATABASE_URL` or individual `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` for PostgreSQL connection.
    *   `API_KEY` for the AI/LLM service you are using.
    *   Any other necessary configuration variables as defined in `.env.example`.

    **Example `.env` structure (based on `.env.example`):**
    ```env
    # Database Configuration (Example using URL format)
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_db_user:your_db_password@your_db_host:your_db_port/your_db_name

    # AI Service Configuration
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_api_key_here # Or the key for your specific service

    # Other settings
    SECRET_KEY=your_strong_secret_key # If applicable for web frameworks etc.
    DEBUG=True # Set to False in production
    ```

### Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

1.  Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.
2.  Create a database and a user for the application if you haven't already.
    *   You can often use tools like `psql` or graphical clients like pgAdmin.
    *   Example `psql` commands:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE ai_tutor_db;
        CREATE USER ai_tutor_user WITH PASSWORD 'strong_password';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ai_tutor_db TO ai_tutor_user;
        -- Connect to the new database and grant schema privileges if needed
        \c ai_tutor_db
        GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO ai_tutor_user;
        ```
3.  Update your `.env` file with the correct database credentials.
4.  **(Optional) Run Database Migrations:** If your project uses a migration tool (like Alembic or Django migrations), run the necessary commands here.
    ```bash
    
    # Example: python manage.py migrate (if using Django)
    # Add the specific command for your project if applicable
    ```

## Roadmap & Future Development üöÄ

We have exciting plans for the future of the AI Tutor!

*   **Integration with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** The immediate next step is to implement RAG. This will allow the AI Tutor to ground its explanations and syllabus suggestions in specific, reliable sources.
*   **Custom Resource Integration:** Enable users to upload or link their own learning materials (e.g., PDFs of textbooks, articles, documentation URLs) for the AI to use as a knowledge base.
*   **Enhanced Syllabus Management:** More interactive tools for refining and tracking progress through the syllabus.
*   **User Profiles & History:** Save learning progress and preferences across sessions.
